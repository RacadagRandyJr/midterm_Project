The function calculates the total bill, 
subtracts the cost of the item Anna didn't eat, 
divides the remaining amount by 2 to get Anna's fair share, 
and then compares it to what she was actually charged (b); if they match, 
it prints "Bon Appetit", otherwise it prints the amount Anna should be refunded.

First initializes a counter `deletions` to zero.
Then it loops through the string from the first character to the second-to-last.
For each character, it checks if it is the same as the next character (`s[i] === s[i + 1]`).
If they are the same, it means one of them must be deleted to make the string alternate, so it increments the `deletions` counter.
After checking all adjacent pairs, it returns the total number of deletions needed.
